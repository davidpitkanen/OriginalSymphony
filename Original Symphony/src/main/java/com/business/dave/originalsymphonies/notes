Still To Do:

1) Once press the record button two times then finish the activity
2) Application crashes when activate before youtube
There's a bunch of scenarios
1) is when press screen off
2) go to sleep
3) video plays till end

Things to fix:
1) Debug -- main thing is playing around with the YouTube controls and seeing if they cause errors
(when you're checking you need to ask if player is playing then do this make sure it's in play mode)
-- also need to double check the permissions
2) Get the song positions to fit
